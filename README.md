# 137-MHz-LNA-SAW

By using a simple double-crossed or QFH antenna it is possible to detect and record the transmission of the NOAA and Meteor-M2 weather satellites. This signal can be received and then decoded into a detailed image of the Earth taken from space! Its quality however, is directly determined by the signal strength. This is where the 137-MHz-LNA-SAW comes into play! The integrated low noise amplifier (LNA) makes the weak signal much stronger. It is then passed through the SAW filter with attenuates all of the unwanted frequencies with a steep cutoff region. The device was designed with ESD safety in mind and features a USB-C port to power the amplifier.
